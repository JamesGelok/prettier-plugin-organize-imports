# Prettier Plugin: Sort TypeScript Imports

A plugin that makes Prettier sort your imports using the `organizeImports` feature of the TypeScript language service API. This is the same as using the "Organize Imports" action in VS Code.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev prettier-plugin-sort-typescript-imports
```

_`prettier` and `typescript` are peer dependencies, so make sure you have those installed in your project._

## Usage

The plugin will be loaded by Prettier automatically. No configuration needed.

## License

[MIT](/license).
